# Front End Software

## Description:
The front end is designed with an html and js capability for <br/>
handeling requests and responses. The visual spacing and design is <br/>
completed via css.

## Comments:
Flask uses a unique link between html, css, and js. The current <br/>
working development is only in ''index.html'' file that contains <br/>
all css and js scripts as well. The documents are broken down for <br/>
easier to document.
