# Front End Software

## Description:
The front end is designed with an HTML and JS capability for handeling requests and responses. The visual spacing and design are completed with CSS. This is also the user interface that the user of the sphere will use in the future.

## Comments:
Flask uses a unique link between HTML, CSS, and JS. The current working development is only in the ''index.html'' file that contains all CSS and JS scripts. The documents are broken down for easier to document.
